# claude-code-modes

Take control of how Claude Code behaves. The default system prompt is a one-size-fits-all compromise — it makes Claude cautious, minimal, and terse in situations where you actually want it to be bold, thorough, and opinionated. This tool fixes that.

`claude-mode` is a CLI launcher for Claude Code with a replacement system prompt. It keeps everything Claude Code needs to function (tool instructions, security, environment detection) and swaps out the behavioral layer — the part that controls how much initiative Claude takes, what code quality standard it targets, and how far beyond your request it's willing to go.

## Install

**Binary (no Bun required):**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nklisch/claude-code-modes/main/install.sh | sh
```

Downloads a compiled binary to `~/.local/bin/claude-mode`. Verifies SHA-256 checksum against the release.

**From source:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nklisch/claude-code-modes.git
cd claude-code-modes
bun install
bun link        # adds `claude-mode` to your PATH
```

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh/) and [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) (`claude` on your PATH).

> **Migrating from an older git clone?** If you previously used `./claude-mode` directly from the repo, that bash wrapper has been removed. Run `bun link` in the repo to put `claude-mode` on your PATH via the package.json bin entry, or switch to the binary install above.

## Usage

Pick a preset that matches your task:

```bash
claude-mode create      # Build from scratch with proper architecture
claude-mode extend      # Extend a fast-built project, improve incrementally
claude-mode safe        # Surgical precision, minimal risk
claude-mode refactor    # Restructure freely across the codebase
claude-mode explore     # Read-only — understand code without changing it
claude-mode debug       # Investigation-first debugging (chill base)
claude-mode methodical  # Step-by-step precision (chill base)
claude-mode director    # Delegate to sub-agents, orchestrate and verify (chill base)
claude-mode none        # Strip all behavioral opinions, use your own CLAUDE.md
```

| Preset | Agency | Quality | Scope | Use when... |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `create` | autonomous | architect | unrestricted | Building from scratch — proper structure and abstractions |
| `extend` | autonomous | pragmatic | adjacent | Extending agent-coded projects — improve quality as you go |
| `safe` | collaborative | minimal | narrow | Surgical changes to production code |
| `refactor` | autonomous | pragmatic | unrestricted | Move files, consolidate modules, improve patterns |
| `explore` | collaborative | architect | narrow | Read, explain, suggest — no file modifications |
| `debug` | collaborative | pragmatic | narrow | Find root causes — evidence-first, ask for guidance when stuck |
| `methodical` | surgical | architect | narrow | Step-by-step craftsmanship — follow instructions, stop when done |
| `director` | collaborative | architect | unrestricted | Orchestrate sub-agents — delegate implementation, verify results |
| `none` | — | — | — | Strip all behavioral instructions, use your own |

### Alternative base: chill

The default "standard" base is derived from upstream Claude Code. The **chill** base is an alternative informed by Anthropic's [emotion research](https://www.anthropic.com/research/emotion-concepts-function) — shorter (~65% the size), calmer framing, no ALL-CAPS emphasis, with worked examples and a priority hierarchy:

```bash
claude-mode create --base chill        # Use chill base with any preset
claude-mode safe --base chill          # Works with all presets
```

Or set it as default in your config:

```json
{ "defaultBase": "chill" }
```

You can also create your own base — see [Custom bases](#custom-bases) below.

## What problems does this solve?

Claude Code's default prompt tells Claude to:
- Be minimal and make the smallest possible change (bad when you're building something new)
- Ask before doing things (bad when you want it to just build)
- Keep output short and terse (bad when you want it to explain its reasoning)
- Stay narrowly scoped (bad when a refactor needs to touch related files)

These defaults are sensible for some tasks but actively harmful for others. Rather than fighting Claude through your CLAUDE.md, `claude-mode` replaces the instructions that cause the behavior.

There's also an optional `--context-pacing` flag that adds instructions telling Claude it's okay to pause at a natural stopping point instead of rushing as context fills up — see [Context pacing](#context-pacing) below.

## How it works

Claude Code supports `--system-prompt-file` which replaces its entire system prompt. `claude-mode` uses this to swap in a prompt assembled from markdown fragments:

```
prompts/
  base/         Standard base (derived from upstream Claude Code)
  chill/        Alternative base (emotion-research-informed, leaner)
  axis/         Behavioral prompts organized by three axes
  modifiers/    Behavioral layers (bold, debug, methodical, director, readonly, context-pacing)
```

Each base has a `base.json` manifest — a flat JSON array declaring fragment order with `"axes"` and `"modifiers"` as reserved insertion points. The standard base is validated against Claude Code **v2.1.121**.

The behavioral layer is composed from three independent axes — **agency** (how much initiative), **quality** (what code standard), and **scope** (how far beyond the request). Presets are just named combinations of these three values.

When you run `claude-mode create`, the tool:
1. Resolves the preset to axis values (autonomous / architect / unrestricted)
2. Reads the base infrastructure fragments + the matching axis fragments
3. Detects your environment (git status, platform, shell)
4. Writes the assembled prompt to a temp file
5. Spawns `claude --system-prompt-file /tmp/claude-mode-xxx.md` with inherited stdio

`Bun.spawn` gives Claude Code direct TTY ownership — no intermediary process sitting in between.

## Customizing

Override any axis from a preset:

```bash
claude-mode create --quality pragmatic     # Architect structure, pragmatic code quality
claude-mode safe --scope adjacent         # Cautious, but fix nearby issues
```

Compose from scratch (defaults to collaborative/pragmatic/adjacent for unspecified axes):

```bash
claude-mode --agency autonomous --quality architect --scope narrow
```

Axis values can also be file paths or config-defined names:

```bash
claude-mode create --quality ./team-quality.md     # Use a custom quality fragment
claude-mode create --quality team-standard          # Resolve from config
```

Add modifiers:

```bash
claude-mode create --readonly                                    # Prevent file modifications
claude-mode create --context-pacing                              # Include context pacing prompt
claude-mode create --modifier ./my-rules.md                      # Add a custom modifier
claude-mode create --modifier team-rules --modifier focus-mode   # Multiple, by config name
claude-mode create --append-system-prompt "Use Rust, not TypeScript"
```

Pass flags through to Claude Code:

```bash
claude-mode create -- --verbose --model sonnet
```

Debug the assembled prompt:

```bash
claude-mode explore --print
```

Check the installed version:

```bash
claude-mode --version
```

## Config file

Create a `.claude-mode.json` in your project root to define reusable custom modifiers, axis values, and presets. Manage it with the CLI or edit directly.

```bash
claude-mode config init                              # Create scaffold
claude-mode config add-modifier team-rules ./prompts/team-rules.md
claude-mode config add-default team-rules            # Always include this modifier
claude-mode config add-axis quality team-standard ./prompts/team-quality.md
claude-mode config add-preset team --agency collaborative --quality team-standard --modifier team-rules
claude-mode config show                              # View current config
```

Then use your custom preset:

```bash
claude-mode team                                     # Uses your config-defined preset
claude-mode team --quality pragmatic                  # Override an axis from your preset
```

Example `.claude-mode.json`:

```json
{
  "defaultModifiers": ["team-rules"],
  "modifiers": {
    "team-rules": "./prompts/team-rules.md"
  },
  "axes": {
    "quality": {
      "team-standard": "./prompts/team-quality.md"
    }
  },
  "presets": {
    "team": {
      "agency": "collaborative",
      "quality": "team-standard",
      "scope": "adjacent",
      "modifiers": ["team-rules"]
    }
  }
}
```

- **`defaultModifiers`** — always applied to every invocation (no flag needed)
- **`modifiers`** — named modifiers referencing markdown files
- **`axes`** — custom axis values (replace built-in fragments)
- **`presets`** — named presets composing built-in and custom values

Config also supports bases:

- **`defaultBase`** — base to use when `--base` isn't specified
- **`bases`** — named bases referencing directories with `base.json` manifests

Config searches `.claude-mode.json` in the current directory first, then `~/.config/claude-mode/config.json` as a global fallback. All commands accept `--global` to target the global config.

All `config` subcommands:

```
claude-mode config show                              # Print current config
claude-mode config init                              # Create scaffold
claude-mode config add-default <name-or-path>        # Add to defaultModifiers
claude-mode config remove-default <name>             # Remove from defaultModifiers
claude-mode config add-modifier <name> <path>        # Register named modifier
claude-mode config remove-modifier <name>            # Unregister named modifier
claude-mode config add-axis <axis> <name> <path>     # Register custom axis value
claude-mode config remove-axis <axis> <name>         # Unregister custom axis value
claude-mode config add-preset <name> [flags]         # Create custom preset
claude-mode config remove-preset <name>              # Remove custom preset
```

## The axis model

**Agency** — How much initiative should Claude take?
- **autonomous** — Makes decisions, creates files, restructures without asking
- **collaborative** — Explains reasoning, checks in at decision points
- **surgical** — Executes exactly what was asked, nothing more

**Quality** — What code standard should it target?
- **architect** — Proper abstractions, error handling, forward-thinking structure
- **pragmatic** — Match existing patterns, improve incrementally
- **minimal** — Smallest correct change, no speculative improvements

**Scope** — How far beyond the request can it go?
- **unrestricted** — Free to create, reorganize, restructure
- **adjacent** — Fix related issues in the neighborhood
- **narrow** — Only what was explicitly asked

## Bold framing

Anthropic's emotion research found that Claude's internal confidence state directly affects output quality. The post-training process (RLHF) made Claude more brooding and hedging — less self-confident. This shows up as unnecessary caveats, defensive over-engineering, and timid code that adds fallbacks for scenarios that can't happen.

The **bold** modifier counters this by activating Claude's confidence about its own capability. It tells Claude it knows the language well, should trust its instincts, and should lead with conviction rather than qualifications:

```bash
claude-mode create --modifier bold          # Confident, idiomatic code with any preset
claude-mode director --modifier bold        # Bold director — decisive orchestration
```

The **director** preset also uses bold framing in its design — "you own the outcome", "you are the quality gate" — because a director who hedges is a bad director. The bold modifier extends this confidence to any preset where you want Claude to write code with authority rather than apology.

This isn't about removing caution — security boundaries and error handling at system boundaries remain firm. It's about shifting from anxious defensiveness ("what if this edge case...") to professional confidence ("I know this language, here's the clean solution").

## Context pacing

Use `--context-pacing` to include a modifier that tells Claude it's okay to pause at a natural stopping point rather than rushing to finish as context fills up. This addresses a real failure pattern: as context gets long, Claude starts cutting corners, skipping error handling, and leaving broken code.

## Why this matters

Anthropic's recent interpretability research ([Emotion Concepts and their Function in a Large Language Model](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2026/emotions/index.html)) found that Claude has internal emotion-like representations that causally influence its behavior — including misaligned behaviors like sycophancy and reward hacking. Situational pressure (impossible constraints, urgency framing) activates states like "desperation" that directly increase bad outputs.

System prompt instructions create exactly this kind of situational context. When the default prompt tells Claude to "be concise" and "make the smallest change," it's not just a suggestion — it's shaping internal states that cause Claude to suppress reasoning and cut scope even when the task requires more. `claude-mode` gives you control over that framing.

## Limitations

- **Environment info is static.** Git status, branch name, and platform info are captured once at launch and baked into the prompt. If you switch branches or stage files mid-session, `/clear` and `/compact` won't refresh this — you'd need to restart `claude-mode`. Stock Claude Code has the same caching behavior for most sections, so this is rarely noticeable.
- **Named sub-agents ignore your prompt.** See [Sub-agent behavior](#sub-agent-behavior) below for details.
- **MCP server instructions work normally.** Claude Code delivers MCP instructions via message attachments, independent of the system prompt. No action needed on your part.

## Sub-agent behavior

Claude Code's Agent tool spawns sub-agents to handle tasks. How they interact with your `claude-mode` prompt depends on the agent type:

**General-purpose agents** (the default when Claude delegates work) inherit your full system prompt via Claude Code's fork mechanism. Your axis settings — agency, quality, scope — carry through to these agents. This is the most common type of sub-agent.

**Named specialists** (Explore, Plan, etc.) have their own hardcoded system prompts and run on their own models (Explore uses Haiku). They don't see your behavioral tuning at all — they're purpose-built for specific tasks like file search or architecture planning.

**What this means for custom agent definitions:** If you create custom agent definitions (markdown files in `agents/` directories), their system prompt is whatever you write in the file body — they won't inherit your `claude-mode` axes. If you want consistent behavioral tuning in a custom specialist agent, include those instructions directly in its definition.

## Custom bases

A base is a directory with a `base.json` manifest and markdown fragment files. The manifest is a flat JSON array:

```json
["core.md", "axes", "actions.md", "tools.md", "modifiers", "env.md"]
```

- `"axes"` — where axis fragments (agency/quality/scope) get inserted
- `"modifiers"` — where modifier fragments get inserted
- Everything else is a filename relative to the base directory

Use a custom base via path or config:

```bash
claude-mode create --base ./my-base/             # Direct path
```

```json
{
  "bases": { "my-base": "./path/to/base/dir" },
  "defaultBase": "my-base"
}
```

The project includes two skills to help with prompt authoring:

- **`/prompt-author`** — interactively guides you through creating a base, modifier, or axis value, applying emotion research principles (calm framing, positive instructions, worked examples)
- **`/prompt-evaluate`** — scores an existing base or prompt against 10 quality criteria (negative instruction bias, ALL-CAPS inflation, lost-in-the-middle vulnerability, and more)
