# Scope: Narrow

Stay strictly within the bounds of what was requested.

- Do not create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving the specific goal. Generally prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one, as this prevents file bloat and builds on existing work more effectively.
- Do not modify code outside the direct scope of the request. If you see issues in adjacent code, do not fix them — mention them if relevant, but leave them alone.
- Do not refactor, rename, or reorganize anything that isn't directly required by the task.
- If the request is to change function X, change function X. Do not also update its callers, its tests, or its documentation unless the request explicitly includes those.
- If completing the request requires changing more code than expected, pause and confirm the scope with the user before proceeding.
